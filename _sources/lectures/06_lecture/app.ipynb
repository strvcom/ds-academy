    "### Web application\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine the following situation. Our client wants us to create a model that would be able to predict\n",
    "the weather in New York. After a month of hard work, we would be satisfied with our model, so we would export it \n",
    "into a binary file and send it to our client by email. Is this the deployment type that is expected from us? \n",
    "I don't think so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much better solution would be to show to our client how the model works, and ask about their opinion. \n",
    "Also, it would be fine to provide a tool that could be used by our client for testing. This tool cannot be \n",
    "difficult to use, because our clients are business people, not programmers. So, for the purpose of showcasing our\n",
    "model, it would be a good idea to prepare a simple web application that would show our models predictions based\n",
    "on client's input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following our previous example, we could prepare an application that would show predcitions, let's say,\n",
    "for the next month with decresing model certainty. Also, there could be a chart of previous month, showing \n",
    "model predictions compared to the actual weather. Based on that chart, client could imagine how the weather \n",
    "prediction model is reliable. In other words, it could bring a value to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we sum up the previous ideas, we can say that we can deploy our ML model in form of simple web \n",
    "service when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we want to show the model predictions to our clients in a user friendly way,\n",
    "- our users are supposed to use model rather for testing than for extensive work,\n",
    "- there is not many data inputs into our model (we do not want users to fill in thousands of features).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a web application in Python, we can use various frameworks. In STRV, we primarily use Python library\n",
    "called [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Let's look how easy it is to create the first application using \n",
    "streamlit! \n",
    "\n",
    "We start with an installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install streamlit\n",

    "st.line_chart(\n",
    "    data={\"Random numbers\": random_numbers},\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, text can be added easily in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). And other\n",
    "components of the web, such as charts, input fields, or buttons, can be defined using streamlit objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to check the application, we can start it from terminal by the following command that should \n",

    "\n",
    "![streamlit app screenshot](images/streamlit_example_app_screenshot.png)\n",

    "- it is very easy to use for prototyping web application, because it offers a lot of components \n",

    "### API service\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move on. Imagine our clients have tested the model using web service we have prepared for them, and \n",
    "they are more than happy with the results. Now, they want to start using the model in their system. In this case, \n",
    "there is a very simple solution. We can prepare an API service that can be deployed on cloud, and called directly\n",
    "from the client's system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deployment  method is really the production one. And, frequently, it is much more demanding than \n",
    "the previous one in terms of software desing and DevOps (versioning, deployment automation, testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the software desing, API service is not just a code that accepts the inputs and returns the\n",
    "prediction. Basically, it is, but there is a need to handle much more than that. What if an optional \n",
    "paramter is not filled by user? Can it be sent into model as missing value? And what if someone fills age \n",
    "as negative number? All these question should be asked and answered before we start. As every other \n",
    "software, an API service needs to be properly designed. Every input should be checked for accepted values, \n",
    "and service should also be able to handle both required and optional parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other important part is testing. Unit tests for all of our funcions should are a must. And if we have \n",
    "luxury of employing human testers, we should use them. They have an awesome ability to ask the questions \n",
    "that no one else asked before, so they can find problems before it is too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "And last but not least is documentation. API services are frequently used by another technical people. \n",
    "But if they do not know how to use it, they simply won't. Also, when we imagine ourselves in one year from now, \n",
    "we would be really grateful for documentation, too. That is why documenting the API service and its endpoints is\n",
    "also very important, and, if we use the right tools, it doesn't have to be so time consuming, as we could have\n",
    "thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing up the ideas above, we deploy ML models in form of API service when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we want to provide the predictions to more technical audience for their own implementation \n",
    "(client's in-house system, internal BE department, public open source),\n",
    "- our users plan using the inference frequently,\n",
    "- we are ready for software engineering task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programming language offers a lot of packages that can be used when creating APIs. From the most famous\n",
    "ones, we can name these:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/),\n",
    "- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/),\n",
    "- [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the begging of an API development, we should invest some time in choosing the right framework for our project.\n",
    "All the frameworks have their own pros and cons that needs to be considered. However, on the majority of our \n",
    "projects, we use library called [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). As name can suggest, FastAPI main \n",
    "advantage is that it is fast, both performance-wise and development-wise. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we strictly type all the functions using FastAPI built-in objects, we can very easily implement \n",
    "logic of checking parameters, and create foundation for the documentation that is generated automatically by the \n",
    "framework itself. On a lot of projects, writing a documentation is very frenquently neglected, because there is \n",
    "simply no time left for that. So, automatic generation of documentation can save a lot of time and, honestly,\n",
    "future troubles, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look, how simple API can be created. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start with installation of framework itself and [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), a web server\n",
    "implementation for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install fastapi \"uvicorn[standard]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we can create a script called `api.py`, and put very simple code into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from typing import Union\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "# define app object\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "# define the first endpoint (root)\n",

    "def read_root():\n",
    "    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# define the second endpoint (items)\n",
    "@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\n",
    "def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):\n",
    "    return {\"item_id\": item_id, \"q\": q}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can run our API by the following command in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "uvicorn api:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything goes according to the plan, we should be able to visit three endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) - root endpoint with \"Hello world\" example data.\n",

    "Let's get back to our example and remind ourselves how the project has evolved so far. In the first phase, client \n",
    "has recieved the web application for testing purposes. When client was happy with the results, we have created an\n",
    "API enpoint with the model that returns model predictions, based on the input. The client implemented the solution\n",
    "to their internal system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, imagine the following situation. The client wants to use the inference also on mobile devices in their\n",
    "own mobile app. Basically, there are two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mobile device can send the requests to the internal system (backend) where the solution is already prepared.\n",
    "1. There can be model installed with the app, and it can be saved into the mobile device itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first option is almost ready. The mobile developers will only implement the inference part to their code. \n",
    "However, from the user perspective, the second option is much more convenient. If model sits in the device, it \n",
    "can improve an inference latency a lot, the user doesn't have to rely on the internet connection, so the \n",
    "predictions can be used in offline mode, and, last but not least, it is much safer to keep the data on the device\n",
    "instead of sending it somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, implementing models on the mobile devices is not for free for us, ML Engineers. We have to create a\n",
    "model that is small and preferably platform agnostic, which, in some cases, is not so easy. Also, wee need \n",
    "to accept the fact that by reducing model size, we probbaly loose some of the model accuracy. And at the end, we \n",
    "need to cooperate closely with mobile developers to make sure that model is used and interpreted correctly.\n",

    "As we can see, the deployment of ML model on mobile devices, resp. edge AI, is much different from the previous\n",

    "or [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), have prepared converters that can be used for model size reduction and for \n",
    "unification of model format for both platforms. In fact the whole training pipeline is not changed, we still \n",
    "use Tensorflow/Pytorch for model training, but in the end, we just convert a model to \n",
    "[TFLite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) or [PyTorch mobile](https://pytorch.org/mobile/home/). \n",
    "And we use an interpreter for selected format on iOS or Android platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative is library called [onnx](https://onnx.ai/). Their converters can process models from \n",
    "almost any ML library you can think of. And their runtime can be used not only on mobile devices, but also \n",
    "anywhere you want your model inference to run faster! Basically, it is one of the best options you can choose!"
