# Selecting Mentors and Topics

The personal project is a great way to apply and practice knowledge from lessons on some real word problems. It is
also an excellent opportunity to explore specific areas more deeply.

## The Project

We would like you to select a project that you are passionate about because you are more likely to complete such
a project and invest time into it.

Once you have some idea/problem of what you want to build/solve, validate it:

- It should be challenging to some extent. A very well-explored problem will probably not teach so much. On the other
  hand, we recommend picking up a problem (or similar one) that was already solved.
- It is interesting enough for someone (at least to you).
- There is some dataset available to you; data can be collected or synthesized.
- A metric to measure a solution exists, or you have a way to evaluate your solution.
- You can come up with some hardcoded solution. It does not have to be perfect, but it can somewhat solve the problem.
  It can be used as a baseline.

Have several (two or three) ideas ready and validated before your first lecture, so you can discuss them with us.

## Selecting Mentors

You will work with your [mentors](../intro.md/#mentors) during the course. Having your problem/idea ready for the first
lecture is vital because each mentor has different expertise, and we want to match you with an appropriate mentor.

## The Presentation

During the last session, you are supposed to present your problem, introduce the solution, and showcase some results.
Each presentation is supposed to fit into **six minutes**, so there is enough time for additional questions.

We expect the following structure:

- Describe the problem you were solving in simple terms, so it is easy to follow. An essential part of the introduction
  is also motivation for the problem.
- Briefly discuss the dataset you used.
- Introduce your solution to the problem. Give a high-level description of your solution.
- Evaluate achieved results and compare them with your expectations (or a baseline, if there is one).
- Describe the following steps, if there are any.

We leave the format of your presentation up to you. However, we prefer a presentation following this
