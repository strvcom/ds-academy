# Understanding, Extracting, Sourcing and Processing Data

Welcome to our second lecture at STRV Data Science Academy. In the first part of the lecture, you will have a chance to
play around with three new libraries: numpy, pandas and matplotlib. Those libraries are essential for data wrangling and
analysis practiced in the second part of the lecture.
