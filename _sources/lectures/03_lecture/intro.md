# Let's learn some ML concepts and do some regression!

Welcome to the third lecture of the Data Science Academy! In this lecture we will demystify supervised vs unsupervised
learning and regression vs classification. Attached to these concepts, we will introduce three different
models/algorithms: linear regression (supervised ML, regression), logistic regression (supervised ML, classification)
and clustering (unsupervised ML).
