# Getting more done with IDEs

Sadly, [Jupyter Notebook](notebooks.ipynb) has a lot of limitations. We prefer using IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) to interact
with notebooks during our day-to-day work. IDEs are perfect when you need functionality such as auto-completion, go-to
definition, syntax-highlighter, spelling checkers, etc.

We have the most experience with the following ones:

## VSCode

VSCode is a **free** tool perfect for working with regular .py and .ipynb (notebook) files. It simplifies version
control, allows you to install thousands of plugins, change themes, run commands in its built-in terminal, and do a lot
more.

## PyCharm or DataSpell

PyCharm or DataSpell (an IDE aimed at Data Science) are very similar to VSCode. However, both are **paid**.
