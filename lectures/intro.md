# Welcome, AI/ML enthusiast

STRV is pleased to offer this 7-week intensive course as part of
our [STRV Academy](https://www.strv.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-strv-academy-inside-strv).
During the course, you will learn to apply plenty of practical and theoretical skills needed for developing and
completing your own End-to-End Machine Learning Projects. You will gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience
with applied ML techniques and an intuitive understanding of what can be achieved through ML and what its
limitations are.

**Hearty thanks to our authors**: [Jan Maly](https://github.com/honzaMaly), [Niek Mereu](https://github.com/niekstrv)
, [Lukas Koucky](https://github.com/lukoucky), and [Jaroslav Bezdek](https://github.com/jardabezdek).

> ✏️ This is the very first run of our **DS Academy**. We want to make the Academy tremendous, so we will ask for a lot
> of feedback. If there is a bug or mistake in the implementation, please create a
> [report on GitHub](https://github.com/strvcom/ds-academy#how-can-i-contribute).

## The Format

The Academy consists of two equally important parts. The first part aims to teach you the necessary practical and
theoretical skills to complete the second part. In the second part, you will work on your personal project.

### Lectures

There will be [six lectures](#the-plan) (not counting the last one) dedicated to introducing you to crucial basic
Machine Learning concepts. Each class is divided into two sessions, separated by a break. We will cover a necessary
theory for you to understand the practical part involving live coding.

The handbook should contain all materials used during lectures. We will extend materials with recordings of each
session once we capture them.

### End-to-End Machine Learning Projects

Each student is supposed to work on their [personal project](01_lecture/selecting_topics.md) during the Academy.
A personal project is a great way to apply and practice knowledge from lessons on some real word problems.
It is also an excellent opportunity to explore specific areas more deeply. Students will be supported by
[mentors](#mentors). Results of projects will be presented during [Demo Day]().

## Getting Started

Before the start of the Academy, we expect you to finish the [preliminary lecture](00_start/intro.md), so you have
everything ready for the first lecture. It is also essential to review the
[initial information for personal projects](01_lecture/selecting_topics.md). In the first lecture, you will be matched
with a [mentor](#mentors) to help you with the project. It is crucial to have a project in mind, so we can find you
an appropriate mentor.
