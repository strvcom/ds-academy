    "\n",
    "Deployment of an AI solution is a crucial part of every ML project. At the beginning, we collect data. After that\n",
    "we look into them, clean them, process them, and we are trying to find valueable insights. When we are done\n",
    "with this phase, which some of us call \"EDA\" (explanatory data analysis), we try to build and test our ML models.\n",
    "And when something doesn't go according to the plan, often because we aren't the domain experts, we go back to our\n",
    "business people, and try to understand the problem better, so we can make our models better. And when we spend\n",
    "some time on testing, and convincing ourselves, that the model we have just came up with is the master piece that\n",
    "can change the whole world, we are supposed to really deploy the model... and, maybe, change the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, without deployment, we wouldn't be able to provide the model to our clients, we wouldn't be able \n",
    "to help business automate, save time, save money, or whatever other reason there is! Simply, we wouldn't be able \n",
    "to add the value that is expected from us in the first place. And that is the reason why the deployment is\n",
    "so crucial."

    "## So... how can I deploy?\n",
    "\n",
    "OK. Now, we know that the ML model deployment process is important, and we know why. But, how can we do that? \n",
    "How can we provide the model to our users? As [one clever man](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niek-mereu-55864a6b/)\n",
    "once said during the third lecture of STRV DS Academy 2022: \"It depends.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web application\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine the following situation. Our client wants us to create a model that would be able to predict\n",
    "the weather in New York. After a month of hard work, we would be satisfied with our model, so we would export it \n",
    "into a binary file and send it to our client by email. Is this the deployment type that is expected from us? \n",
    "I don't think so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much better solution would be to show to our client how the model works, and ask about their opinion. \n",
    "Also, it would be fine to provide a tool that could be used by our client for testing. This tool cannot be \n",
    "difficult to use, because our clients are business people, not programmers. So, for the purpose of showcasing our\n",
    "model, it would be a good idea to prepare a simple web application that would show our models predictions based\n",
    "on client's input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following our previous example, we could prepare an application that would show predcitions, let's say,\n",
    "for the next month with decresing model certainty. Also, there could be a chart of previous month, showing \n",
    "model predictions compared to the actual weather. Based on that chart, client could imagine how the weather \n",
    "prediction model is reliable. In other words, it could add the client some value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we sum up the previous ideas, we can say that we can deploy our ML model in form of simple web \n",
    "service when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we want to show the model predictions to our clients in a user friendly way,\n",
    "- our users are supposed to use model rather for testing than for extensive work,\n",
    "- there is not many data inputs into our model (we do not want users to fill in thousands of features).\n",
    "\n",
    "### API service\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move on. Imagine our clients have tested the model using web service we have prepared for them, and \n",
    "they are more than happy with the results. Now, they want start using the model in their system. In this case, \n",
    "there is a very simple solution. We can prepare an API service that can be deployed on cloud, and called directly\n",
    "from the client's system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deployment  method is really the production one. And, frequently, it is much more demanding than \n",
    "the previous one in terms of software desing and DevOps (versioning, deployment automation, testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the software desing, API service is not just a code that accepts the inputs and returns the\n",
    "prediction. Basically, it is, but there is a need to handle much more than that. What if an optional \n",
    "paramter is not filled by user? Can it be sent into model as missing value? And what if someone fills age \n",
    "as negative number? All these question should be asked and answered before we start. As every other \n",
    "software, API service needs to be properly designed. Every input should be checked for accepted values, \n",
    "and service should also be able to handle both required and optional parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other important part is testing. Unit tests for all of our funcions should be must. And if we have luxury of \n",
    "employing human testers, we should use them. They have an awesome ability to ask the questions that no one else\n",
    "asked before, so they can find problems before it is too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "And last but not least is documentation. API services are frequently used by another technical people. \n",
    "But if they do not know how to use it, they simply won't. Also, when we imagine ourselves in one year from now, \n",
    "we would be really grateful for documentation, too. That is why documenting the API service and its endpoints is\n",
    "also very important, and, if we use the right tools, it doesn't have to be so time consuming, as we could have\n",
    "thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing up the ideas above, we deploy ML models in form of API service when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we want to provide the predictions to more technical audience for their own implementation \n",
    "(client's in-house system, internal BE department, public open source),\n",
    "- our users plan use the inference frequently,\n",
    "- we are ready for software engineering task.\n",
