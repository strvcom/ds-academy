    "Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that allows applications to be hosted on the cloud. \n",
    "With a few limitations, Heroku has been offering free tier for smaller applications. \n",
    "Their pricing plan will change at the end of the November 2022, so for purposes of the DS Academy 2022, we can \n",
