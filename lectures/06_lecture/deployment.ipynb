    "a good job, our colleague asks us to share the script with him, so we send the code via the Slack. But, the\n",
    "the colleague starts complaining that the code isn't working.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we can basically say that our script is an application that we want to deploy on our colleague's\n",
    "local machine. And the reason why it isn't working is simple. We have different environments. The colleague didn't\n",
    "say that he uses Python 2 only, and he hasn't installed pandas package yet. Because we are in theory, he could \n",
    "even use a different OS, and definetely, he has got a different file system, so none of the absolute paths used \n",
    "in our script wouldn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what can we do to prevent this from happening again? As the simplest solution, we can define the python\n",

    "new environment based on our specifications. Or we can share `requirements.txt` file with list of all the python\n",

    "- its own OS,\n",
    "- its own file system,\n",
    "- the only one (and correct) version of Python,\n",
    "- minimum necessary requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is something we can create using [docker](https://www.docker.com/). Docker uses its own nomenclature, so\n",
    "let's describe the whole process a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The isolated environment is defined in script called `Dockerfile`. It contains specification about OS, file \n",

    "docker image is created. Docker image is a logical entity that can be shared between users. The running \n",

    "\n",
    "As stated before, `Dockerfile` is a script using docker conventions in order to define docker image. For \n",
    "`Dockerfile`, there are commonly used commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FROM` - indicates which base image to use.\n",
    "- `ARG` - defines variables that users pass in at build-time.\n",
    "- `USER` - sets username or user group when running docker image.\n",
    "- `COPY` - copies files and directories into environment.\n",
    "- `WORKDIR` - sets the working directory inside container.\n",
    "- `ENV` - sets environment variable.\n",
    "- `RUN` - runs shell command.\n",
    "- `EXPOSE` - informs docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime, \n",
    "used for testing docker applications locally.\n",
    "- `CMD` - is used only once at the end of `Dockerfile` and contains the final command to run \n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker build -t api-titanic-survival-model:latest .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If docker image is built successfully, we can try to run the docker container. In the command, we define\n",
    "environment variable `PORT` that is used inside the docker container for running the web server on the \n",
    "specific port. Also, we will use `-p` argument that lets us to publish a container's port to the host.\n",
    "With `-p 8000:8000` we are basically saying docker to expose container port 8000 and map it to port 8000 of our\n",
    "local machine. Lastly, we need to define which image we would like to run. For that purpose we use the tag from\n",
    "previous build phase.\n",
