# Deploying & Managing an AI solution in production

Welcome to the sixth lecture of the STRV Data Science Academy!

After the previous lectures, you should have some idea about how to process
the data and use them to train the best model possible in order to solve your
ML problem. However, we still do not know how to provide the model to the users.

Don't worry. This lecture will show you the way!

## The Plan

| Break                                                 | 15 minutes |
